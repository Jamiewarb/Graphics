function scene = simplescene
% SIMPLESCENE Gives a starting scene to base your ray tracer off
%
% Adapted from other files in this 
%
% USAGE: Just write 
%   scene = simplescene;
% either at the Matlab prompt or in your script (then run your script).
% This will load in 'scene' as a variable, and you can explore it using the
% Workspace box in the top right of Matlab.
%
% The scene will have the following format
% * scene.objects: This contains some number of objects in the scene.
% -€“ object.x: Ignore, gives original points, use transformed points instead.
% -€“ object.p: Transformed points. Each column is a point in 3D space.
% -€“ object.q: Ignore, gives mid-way points before final transformations.
% -€“ object.tri: Each column is a triangle in this object, lists three points in object.p.
% -€“ object.colour: Each column gives the colour of the corresponding triangle. 
%             First three rows are RGB values. 
%             Final three give ratios of base color/reflected colour/refracted colour.
% -€“ object.n: The normal for each triangle.
% -€“ object.vt: These define UV points within a hypothetical texture map (image)
% -€“ object.tri_uvs: For each triangle, gives the points from object.vt which should be used for texturing
% -€“ object.name: A human-readable string describing the shape of the object.
% * scene.numberofobjects: The total number of objects, equal to the length of the object field, for easy reference.
% * scene.imagesize: The resolution for this render, given as [width, height].
% * scene.windowsize: The size of the image plane (in the 3D space), given as [width, height]. 
% * scene.ambientlight: The values to use for the ambient light, RGB.
% * scene.directionallight: Each column contains the location of a light in 3D space.
% * scene.cam: The camera definition to use. Has the following fields:
% -€“ cam.focus: The focal point of the camera in 3D space.
% -€“ cam.focallength: The distance between the focal point and the image plane.
% -€“ cam.{up,right,forward}: The orientation of the camera.
% -€“ cam.coi: The centre of the image plane, computed from the other values for easy reference.
